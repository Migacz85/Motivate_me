Here you have a super simple bash script that you can run in bash konsole. In every distro of linux. I created it just to simply random print a motivational sentence from a .csv file. Usage is realy simple, download the script with .csv file and just run the script in linux konsole. You can create your own .csv file with sentences. Remmember that whole sentence need to be in ONE line. After running the script ONE line from the .csv file will be randomly printed in bash konsole.
